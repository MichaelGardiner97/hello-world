# hello-world

Hello! My name is Michael Gardiner, a student at Ithaca College. I play for the tennis team here at IC, but I also enjoy basketball, biking, and video games.

I am a beginner coder, and my goals include creating and developing my own apps and boosting my coding knowledge as much as possible.
